# Frontity Template

This template provides a convenient way for you to quickly and easily spin up a Frontity project on either [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

## CodeSandbox

CodeSandbox is a great prototyping tool that you can use to bootstrap a project. You can use this template to create a new Frontity project on CodeSandbox, or if you already have a Frontity project on GitHub you can use that on CodeSandbox too. Instructions for doing both follow.

### Using this template for a new project

- Click on this link: https://githubbox.com/frontity/frontity-template _(use CTRL/CMD + click to open in a new tab)_.
- Wait until the Frontity application starts _(it could take a few seconds)_.
- Click on "Fork" to make your own copy.

- Make any changes you wish to customise the project.

### Using your own project

- Copy the URL of your GitHub repository.

  ![Github URL](./readme-images/github-url.png)

- Rename the domain from `github.com` to `githubbox.com`.

  ![Github URL renamed](./readme-images/githubbox-url.png)

- Enter the new URL in the browser's address bar and press 'Enter'.
- Wait until the Frontity application starts _(it could take a few seconds)_.
- Click on "Fork" to make your own copy _(see above)_.
- Make any changes you wish to further customise the project.

## StackBlitz

StackBlitz is an online IDE where you can create projects with just one click. It automatically takes care of installing dependencies, compiling, bundling, and hot reloading as you type.

You can use this template to create a new Frontity project on StackBlitz, or if you already have a Frontity project on GitHub you can use that on StackBlitz too. Instructions for doing both follow.

### Using this template for a new project

- Click on this link: https://stackblitz.com/fork/frontity _(use CTRL/CMD + click to open in a new tab)_.
- Wait until the command prompt appears.

  ![StackBlitz command prompt](./readme-images/sb-command-prompt.png)

- Run `npm install`.

  ![StackBlitz npm install](./readme-images/sb-npm-install.png)

- Run `npx frontity dev` to start Frontity _(it could take a few seconds)_.

  ![StackBlitz npx frontity dev](./readme-images/sb-npx-frontity-dev.png)

- Make any changes you wish to customise the project.

### Using your own project

- Add the following to your `package.json`:

  ```json
  {
    "workspaces": ["packages/*"]
  }
  ```
  _This is necessary until they add support for `file:/packages...` syntax ([related GH issue](https://github.com/stackblitz/webcontainer-core/issues/107))._

- Commit the change _(and if necessary push to GitHub)_.
- Go to https://stackblitz.com/
- Create a new "Node.js" project.

  ![StackBlitz new nodejs project](./readme-images/sb-new-node-project.png)

- Click on "Connect repository"

  ![StackBlitz connect repository](./readme-images/sb-connect-repo.png)

- Click on "Import an existing repository"

  ![StackBlitz import an existing repository](./readme-images/sb-import-repo.png)

- Enter the URL of your repository. For example: https://github.com/frontity/frontity-template _(you may need to authenticate your GitHub account at this point)_.

  ![StackBlitz repository URL](./readme-images/sb-repo-url.png)

- Once the project is ready delete the `package-lock.json` file _(if it exists)_.

  ![StackBlitz delete package-lock.json](./readme-images/sb-delete-pkglock.png)

- Run `npm install` in the terminal box

  ![StackBlitz npm install](./readme-images/sb-npm-install2.png)

- A new `package-lock.json` file will be created

  ![StackBlitz new package-lock.json created](./readme-images/sb-pkglock-created.png)

- Start Frontity by running `npx frontity dev` in the terminal box  _(it could take a few seconds)_.

  ![StackBlitz npx frontity dev](./readme-images/sb-npx-frontity-dev2.png)
